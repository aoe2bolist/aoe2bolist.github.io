"Straight eagle scouts; allows constant production from two barracks upon reaching Feudal. Requires both blacksmith upgrades early on for them to be effective. Could be followed either with ranges for archer transition, or a third barracks for full eagles. Usually no viable against experienced opponents, with men-at-arms - eagles being a better (but still farily uncommon) option. Aztecs are the most viable for this build due to shorter creation time. (More commonly, eagle scouts would begin massing in late Feudal so there is an army ready to upgrade upon reching Castle.)", by Cicero.
