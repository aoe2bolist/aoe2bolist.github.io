"This is a 'slower' build, since archers need to be massed to be effective. Unlike scouts, the aim is to keep the ranges working constantly - archers also need fletching as a minimum to be effective. This is ofter a poor build to use for 1v1, partly because it is quite weak against the faster scout build, so it is mainly used in team games as flank where its weaknesses can be covered by other players.", by Cicero.
