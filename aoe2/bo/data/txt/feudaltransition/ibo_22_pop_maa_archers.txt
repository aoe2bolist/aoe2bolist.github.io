"This build allows involves creating three (or four) militia while advancing and researching the men-at-arms upgrade upon hitting Feudal. This build is one way of buying time to mass archers, since your opponent is usually forced to deal with the men-at-arms in their base first. This build is quite tight (and therefore difficult), meaning horse collar usually needs to be skipped.", by Cicero.
