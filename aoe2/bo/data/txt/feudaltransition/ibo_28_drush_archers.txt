"A Dark Age rush; three militia created in Dark Age used to delay the opponent. This is another way of buying time to mass archers. At time of writing, this build has become less popular, with the men-at-arms build being preferred. It can be quite weak against men-at-arms build, since the opponent will have militia to defend, which can then be upgraded after they hit Feudal first.", by Cicero.
