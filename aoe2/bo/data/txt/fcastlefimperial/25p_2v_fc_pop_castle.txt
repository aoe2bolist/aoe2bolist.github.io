"The build order is of intermediate level: while it doesnt require you to push or hunt deer, it's still relatively tight and you will have to keep your villagers working and efficient at all times. You will need to be able to do basic tricks such as scouting, using houses to wall your base/resources, dropping off food, luring boar without loom and placing good lumber/mining camps.", by Holenz. Also from Holenz: "25+2 can't maintain 2TCs and UU. I tested it with Vietnamese Rattan Archers and Goth's Huskarls (no eco bonuses) and it's super tight, but it just narrowly works. If you drop your second TC first and your castle second and allocate your vills just right, you can maintain production from all three buildings. I can send the recorded games to everyone who doesn't believe it.".
