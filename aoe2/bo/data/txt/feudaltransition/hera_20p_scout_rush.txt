A more general Scout Rush with 4 vils on Berries, good for early pressure with creating of Scouts. Luring deer before getting the first Boar helps on consuming only 4 of the possible total of 8 sheep. However, you can still use 5 sheeps and lure the deer after. It helps to get a more boost to your food income. PS:<b>Got this build with Franks, which can also get Forging at Feudal Age from early blacksmith, due to its Berries Bonus.</b>
